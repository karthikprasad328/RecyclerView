# RecyclerView
Explored RecyclerView, CardView and also multiple ViewHolder classes in Recyclerview Adapter

Load the movie data into a RecyclerView. Each row of the RecyclerView should contain at least the following information: the image of movie, title, description, rating, and a CheckBox. You can design your own layout. There should be three buttons above the RecyclerView. You need to implement the following functionalities:
a) (20) Get the RecyclerView to work; each row should be a CardView.
b) (5) When the CheckBox is clicked, its status will be toggled. However, when the row is clicked, the CheckBox will not be toggled; this is different from the previous homework.
c) (5) When the “Select All” button is clicked, all the CheckBoxes will be checked. When the “Clear All” button is clicked, all the CheckBoxes will be unchecked.
d) (5) When the “Delete” button is clicked, all the selected movies will be deleted from the list. Users should be able to see the animation effect.
e) (10) When a list item is long clicked, that item will be duplicated and placed right below the current item (i.e., a new movie item with duplicated content will appear). Users should be able to see the animation effect.
f) (5) When a list item is clicked, a Toast message will display the name of the selected movie.
g) (10) When the phone’s orientation changes, the selected movies should stay selected.
h) (20) The movies with 8.0 rating and above should have a different layout than those below 8.0. For example, for the above-8.0 movies, the image is placed on the left, but for the below-8.0 movies, the image will be placed on the right. Their layout files should be different.
